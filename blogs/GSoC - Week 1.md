# GSoC - Week 1

---

Hey everyone! I am so excited to say that I got accepted into the **GSoC** ~~(Good Supply of Carrots?)~~ (Google Summer of Code). That brings me here, writing my experience as I go on this sacred summer coding conquest.

## Introduction

---

~~I am sure you must have all heard about me.~~ I am **Prayas Jain**, and I just really love to code ~~and then cry over the errors~~ because after putting in hours into a project and finally seeing it bear fruit is one thing I could never get tired of. I am an IT undergraduate, and I will be walking into the final year (hopefully?) of my college life.

Over the course of my college life, I have been told "Hey, <someone> has been accepted into GSoC" countless times, and looking at them with an envious eye, I could see their growth, at how their coding capabilities flourished when working on an open-source project. 

That is how I decided to get my share of experience with open-source development, which led me to apply for GSoC this year. ~~Envy isn't so bad, huh?~~

## Choosing the Project

---

**Choices**, *choices*, <u>choices</u>. There are so many choices given how the open-source community has expanded over the last few years. To this, a friend of mine, let's call him theFriend (I absolutely love camelcase), who has been contributing under Weecology for a year now, suggested I give a look at the Portalcasting project under them.

The `portalcasting` package provides a model development, deployment, and evaluation system for forecasting how ecological systems change through time, with a focus on a widely used long-term study of mammal population and community dynamics. 

The project proposed for GSoC this year under Portalcasting seemed a good fit with respect to what I like to do. The task is to eliminate the embarrassingly parallel problems (sounds embarrassing, right?) that are present throughout the codebase.

The last project that I did had a similar issue, so this particular project spoke to me, That's when I decided to choose this project ~~and use 100% of my system RAM, leading to system crashes~~. 

\**cough*\* *\*cough*\*

Moving on, I contacted Henry Senyondo to show my interest in this project and how it is shimmering in front of me. Henry, being a great mentor, helped me understand the Portal project a bit more, as to what the project entails and what needs to be done within it. 
Even through the hectic ~~and soul-drenching~~ process of proposal submission, Henry guided me at each corner as to what is a good way to write proposals so as to bring out our vision in a way it is understandable by everyone, irrespective of whether they know about this project or not.  

The deadline for submission of the proposal was April 19th, while my birthday was on April 17th. While enjoying the night of my birthday, I woke up with a realization,

*"Oh fudge. I have to write my proposal."*

The final touches and changes that needed to be made remained, and submitting a ***good*** proposal was on the line for a while.

## Acceptance (not the relationship kind)

---

"wow".

That was what my mind had at the time when I saw my name listed under the names of people whose projects were accepted. Acceptance felt great at that time, ~~not because someone rejected me recently or anything (lol)~~, and my mind left my body on a different plane of reality. 

It was dinner time for me, and the list hadn't updated. My food was looking at me with glittery eyes, trying to lure me into eating it, yet I anxiously waited by GSoC's website.
When the wait was over, the dinner tasted extra special due to the extravagant flavour of this news.

## Community Bonding

---

During the course of the community bonding period, Henry had been helping me understand the essence of the Portal Project, regarding how it has been conducted on the ground. Apart from that, we would have weekly meetings with the other selected contributors under Weecology; Ansh and Nagesh. Working in an open-source environment, we get to see different ideas and learn from them in a very ***open*** manner.

Moving on, during the course of this project, my main aim would be to improve on the areas I know I am lacking in terms of coding, as well as to gather experience in collaborating, since that is a very integral skill when working on big and complex projects.

## * runs away *

---

I am not really running away, but I believe I have conveyed everything that I wanted to convey ~~without letting my introverted side take over~~. I'll be taking my leave and going to watch Anya-san say *"waku waku"*. Bye.
